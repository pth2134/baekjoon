unary_op ::= ‘+’ term | ‘-’ term
term ::= ‘(’ expr ‘)’ | ‘(’ unary_op ‘)’ | literal
literal ::= [0-9]</pre>

<p>There will be no whitespace within an expression. All expressions will consist solely of the characters (, ), +, -, and the digits 0 through 9. You may assume that all input is well-formed.</p>

<p>There will be no blank lines in the file.</p>
